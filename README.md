## Project description
Our product is a highly secured banking system that is only accessed by authorized users, it stores accounts of customers and their amount of money. Customers can transfer money between accounts by the help of employees. There are 10 members working on this project in an agile manner. We aim to create a suitable sized database that can contain all records needed linked with a friendly graphical user interface that all users can handle easily so that it can cover all banking responsibilties required. Employees will be able to handle all customers accounts' functionalities using the system

## My product Vision
### Stakeholders:
* Bank Owner
* Bank Managers
* Bank employees

### Far Vision:
Create a banking system that have a user friendly GUI handled by employees and managers that can do the following:
Create/edit/delete accounts
Manage loans and benefits
Deposit/withdraw money 
Check customers' account details

### Near Vision (Sprint 1):
Create a secured database that contain all customers' accounts
Assign database access to only authorized users
Friendly user interface with homepage that allow users to login to the system
Employees can add new customers to the database

### Near Vision (Sprint 2):
Create employee's account page
Employees edit and control all customer's functionalities

## User Story Points estimation convention:
Fibonacci Series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...), where 13 represents big story that needs a lot of functionalities and could be vague to the members so it will take about 5 working days. While 1 and 3 points represent well-known stories as homepage or account page design that does not need an effort and could be finished in 1 day or less. And 8 represent around 3 days.

## Product Backlog Items (ordered rationale):
The rationale of this order of my Product Backlog Items is that our team see it is the most important thing to crete a secured database to hold all customers' accounts.
then it must be secured to prevent data theft. Then the employee will need to login through a homepage to his account. After that the system verify his login details. to move the user (employee) to his account page (which is completed in sprint 2). Then employee and manager could be able to add records to the database.Then the design of the account of employee is done in sprint 2 which allow the employee to do all the customers ' account functionalities. Here are some of the PBIs ordered from the highest priority to least ones.
* A user friendly interface with homepage that have system login credentials is needed at the first thing to allow users to enter system easily before anybanking complications (assigned to Ahmad Ossama & Ali Mohamed). This story has the highest business value for the product owner as he wants simple UI to start acting with the system.
* Database created and must be accessed by only authorized users to prevent any corruption of confidential data as customers' account numbbers and transactions so it is very important to be finished quickly (assigned to Ahmad Sobhy & Sara Sabry)
* Register/login new user account to the system is very important after storing records for login credentials in database to allow the users to use the system freely using their private accounts (assigned to Khaled Emad)
* After that the employee can now add customers to the database so this option will be qualified for him to add them in database (assigned to Yara Wagdy).
* Then Employee could also add records as transactions to customers' accounts which is dependent on the previous story (assigned to Yara Wagdy).
* Manager which can also login to the system should have functionality of adding new employees has the least priority as adding new employees was not of high business value for the product owner (assigned to Omar fathy).

The whole order of PBIs can be seen in the screenshots document
