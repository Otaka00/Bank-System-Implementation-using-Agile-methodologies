## Project description
Our product is a highly secured banking system that is only accessed by authorized users, it stores accounts of customers and their amount of money. Customers can transfer money between accounts by the help of employees. There are 10 members working on this project in an agile manner. We aim to create a suitable sized database that can contain all records needed linked with a friendly graphical user interface that all users can handle easily so that it can cover all banking responsibilties required. Employees will be able to handle all customers accounts' functionalities using the system

## Story Points
Our team could do up to an average of 40 points in each sprint. Each sprint is 3 weeks.

## User Story Points estimation convention:
Fibonacci Series (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...), where 13 represents big story that needs a lot of functionalities and could be vague to the members so it will take about 5 working days. While 1 and 3 points represent well-known stories as homepage or account page design that does not need an effort and could be finished in 1 day or less. And 8 represent around 3 days.

## Product Backlog Items (ordered rationale):
The rationale of this order of my Product Backlog Items is that our team see it is the most important thing to crete a secured database to hold all customers' accounts.
then it must be secured to prevent data theft. Then the employee will need to login through a homepage to his account. After that the system verify his login details. to move the user (employee) to his account page (which is completed in sprint 2). Then employee and manager could be able to add records to the database.Then the design of the account of employee is done in sprint 2 which allow the employee to do all the customers ' account functionalities
